# Device Classification with Random Forest

## Task
Using Machine Learning to identify devices (sensors) based on the specifications provided.

## The Machine Learning Approach
In the realm of Machine Learning, this is an elegant **supervised classification** problem. 
Now, when it comes to classifying something, there are tons of algorithms to choose from. 
But, for this task, we need a robust, dynamic and an algorithm which can work really well
with large datasets and variations. These algorithmic requirements lands us right on top of
one well-known machine learning algorithm called, **_Random Forest_**
